## CS 562 JVM

This JVM is written for the virtual machines course at IIT.

To build the JVM, clone it to your computer and run `cmake ./` from within the cloned project. Then run `make`. It will create an executable called `jvm` which can be run. Running it with no arguments will display all the options you can pass.
